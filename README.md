# Dev Ieffe - CodePen 

My Codepen portfolio — a collection of interactive front-ends, UI prototypes, and micro-interactions built with HTML/SCSS (mainly in Tailwind, Bootstrap), and JavaScript (GSAP, Vanilla, Canvas).

## ✨ What's in stack
🗒️ Concept demos – ideas for UI/UX, layout, and dark mode  
🔁 Reusable code patterns – minimal, and developer-friendly  
💻 CSS mock ups of computer tech (laptops, tablets, smartphones)  
🎨 Modern UI components and CSS drawings – buttons, cards, loaders, and more  
⚡️ Micro-interactions – hover effects, animations, and transitions
